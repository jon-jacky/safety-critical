Web site about safety-critical systems, including a review article, a
lecture, and some exercises.

This web site was made by Jonathan Jacky at the University of
Washington in the 1990s.  It is archived here for personal and
historical interest.

This is a web site, so all of the content is in the gh-pages branch.
