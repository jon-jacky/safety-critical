<strong>Abstract</strong>
</center>
<p>
Using computers to control
hazardous machinery raises difficult questions. Some are
specific to computing: Why use computers at all, if satisfactory
techniques already exist? Do computers introduce new kinds
of problems unlike those encountered in traditional control
systems? What techniques exist now for creating safe and
reliable computer-controlled systems, and could they be
improved? Other questions are perennial for society at large
but are only now beginning to be considered in the computing
field: How are we to decide whether a product is safe enough
to place on the market? How can we ensure that product
developers and service providers are competent and that poor
practices are discouraged? Who is held responsible when
systems fail and people get killed?

This report describes and analyses a series of fatal accidents
involving a computer-controlled medical device.  It briefly describes
some experiences with other safety-critical systems in medicine, aviation,
ground transport, nuclear power and military technology.  It describes
current practices in system development and software engineering, and
discusses prospects for improvement through various approaches ranging
from formal methods to regulations and legal remedies.  This report
provides over 100 references to pertinent literature.
